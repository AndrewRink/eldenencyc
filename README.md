ELDEN RING ENCYCLOPEDIA

This app was developed by Andrew Rink and was simply a way for me to practice using React, making API calls, and displaying the data.
I'm sure there is more efficient way of searchig, such as adding filters to the search bar and keeping it on one page, but that wasn't my goal when creating this.  

Hopefully if someone stumbles across this, they find it useful or can build off what I have already created.
